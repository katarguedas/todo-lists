# todo-lists


Todo-lists is a small project of a simple To-Do app built with MERN stack and styled with styled-components.
Using the four most common HTTP requests methods GET, POST, PUT and DELETE, the  *todo-lists* represents a CRUD application. 
The requests are realized by the axios client.


The application contains three lists, so you can save To-Dos for today, tomorrow and soon. 
You can create new To-Dos, delete them and shift them from one list to another. Additionally, you can create notes.
This simple application doesn't have any user authentication so, be carefully writing your To-Dos - everyone could see them ;-)
